# Photoswipe

Photoswipe provides a jQuery-based photo gallery offering good mobile browsing features, in
particular swiping to the next picture.

It is a port to Backdrop of the Drupal module, v7.x-2.0 beta 4 (Dec 2018).

## Dependencies

It depends on the third party PhotoSwipe library described at https://photoswipe.com.
This library is now included in this module.


## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.


## Usage

### Multiple images in nodes
Within 'Manage Displays' for a content type that includes images, select 'Photoswipe' 
for the format of an image field. Then choose the settings for the node images and the
photoswipe images. Multiple images will then be displayed as a gallery.

### Single image in node
Photoswipe can be used similarly for fields for single images within a content type.
In such cases Photoswipe provides a 'lightbox' type of display of the image but not,
of course, a gallery.

### Multiple images in Views
Choose the option 'Photoswipe' as the 'Formatter' for the image field.
Choose a predefined style for your node images (i.e. thumbnails).
Also choose a larger style or the original image for your Photoswipe image.

Within 'Multiple Field Settings' un-check the item 'Display all values in the same row.'
Within 'Other' settings for your view, set the CSS class 'photoswipe-gallery'.
Within 'Format' settings, un-check the row settings.
